<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>
    With so many amazing video games coming year after year, it’s hard to keep track of all the games that you wish to
    play.
</p>
<p>
    Wistarr List is an app that lets you make a list of all the games that you want to buy. You just need to add a game’s
    name, and it will be recorded into your wish list. Optionally, you could also include the console and the store’s
    name.
</p>
<p>
    Keep track of all the games that you wish to buy, both old and new, with Wistarr List. Check our app while you’re
    browsing stores like Steam or the PlayStation Network so that you remember to buy those wonderful games that you had
    forgotten that you wanted to buy. It’s also useful if those games are on sale.
